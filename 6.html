    <title>6. Max Characters in a String</title>

            <h1>Max Characters in a string</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p>Alright, so now we're getting somewhere. In this problem, you will be given a string, and you will write an algorithm to return the character that appears the most times within that string. There are several ways to solve this particular problem, so if you do it one way, and I do it another, no problem.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>This problem is a really valuable one becuase it is the first one where we are going to have to start working with data structres to solve it. Object trees are a must to know, and this is a good problem to learn ont. Good luck.
