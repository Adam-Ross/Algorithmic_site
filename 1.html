            <p>We'll start out by solving the first problem of the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> problem set. Project Euler is a great resource and I highly suggest checking it out.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Either way, our problem is not that difficult. Let's talk about it. Our problem is to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. So, what will we need. First, we will need to be able to get all of the numbers below 1000 that are multiples of three and five, and we will have to store them, or we will have to keep a running tally, maybe a variable called sum, that we can add to. Give it a minute, try to come up with an answer - after finished, check out the video below where I walk through the problem step by step.</p>
